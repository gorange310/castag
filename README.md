# Alpha Blog

This is a blog app\
I'm currently a Ruby/Rails app developer, this is my personal project when I was learn from Udemy Course: the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course.

I followed RESTful conventions for my routes but since I was only utilizing certain functions, I added limitations to them.\
Users can only be showed.\
Stcoks can only be updated.\
It isn't full CRUD but enough to implement the user stories required. Thereâ€™s also room to expand in the future to for the other CRUD features.

I expanded model: Comment, and RESTful for the routes. Guest can sign up and post the comment on each post.
